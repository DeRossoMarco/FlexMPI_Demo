## Files

- `demo.c`: The main C source file containing the MPI program.
- `Makefile`: The makefile to compile the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- EMPI library

## Setup

1. Ensure that the MPI and EMPI libraries are installed on your system.
2. Update the `LIBEMPI_DIR` variable in the `Makefile` to point to the location of your EMPI library.

## Build
